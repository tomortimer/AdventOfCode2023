I don't know how far I'll get this year, only did up till 13 last year. But it's a fun challenge and a good opportunity to apply some of the things I've learnt. Most solutions will be in C# and an occasional python one, if it suits the problem better. Would be nice if I could get a functional solution in this year.

Later Note: Probably won't get functional in this year, but I'm happy to be exploring a lot of the DSA that I didn't have access to last year. Will do different languages in the future hopefully :)

# General Structure
- Each day has its own folder
- A library of general DSs and some utility is built in MorteTools (all c# projects reference this)
