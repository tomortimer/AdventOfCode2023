I don't know how far I'll get this year, only did up till 13 last year. But it's a fun challenge and a good oppurtunity to apply some of the things I've learnt. Most solutions will be in C# and an occasional python one, if it suits the problem better, I'm more comfortable with lambda and regex in python. Would be nice if I could get a functional solution in this year.
